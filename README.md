## Important Notes / FAQ's
:question: _I can't walk more than 10 steps and my torch turns on_

:bulb: Make sure "HUD Always On" is Enabled in the "Gameplay" settings.

:question: _I can't run/sprint_

:bulb: Lower your weapon, you can not run and aim/shoot in this game.

---
:question: _When physically turning and I get on a ladder the camera clips and/or character is the wrong side of the ladder_

:bulb: I am aware of this, this profile/mod does not currently support FULL Roomscale i.e. Physical Turning.
